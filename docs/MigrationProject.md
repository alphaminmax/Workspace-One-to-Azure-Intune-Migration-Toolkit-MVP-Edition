# Workspace One to Azure Migration Project

## Project Overview

This project focuses on migrating device management from VMware Workspace One to Microsoft Azure. The migration involves transitioning device enrollment, configuration management, application deployment, and compliance policies from Workspace One to Azure Intune.

## Goals and Objectives

1. **Complete Migration**: Fully transition all managed devices from Workspace One to Azure Intune
2. **Minimize Disruption**: Ensure minimal user impact during the migration process
3. **Maintain Security Posture**: Preserve or enhance security controls during and after migration
4. **Leverage Azure Capabilities**: Take advantage of Azure's modern management features
5. **Streamline Management**: Consolidate management platforms to reduce operational overhead

## Key Components

### Core Migration Tools

- **TestScripts.ps1**: Validates PowerShell scripts for syntax and initialization to ensure script quality during migration
- **LoggingModule.psm1**: Provides enhanced logging capabilities for all migration operations
- **Test-WS1Environment.ps1**: Analyzes the current Workspace One environment to establish migration baselines

### Migration Phases

1. **Assessment**: Inventory current Workspace One environment and configurations
2. **Planning**: Design Azure environment architecture and migration strategy
3. **Implementation**: Build Azure environment and migration tooling
4. **Testing**: Validate migration process in controlled environment
5. **Execution**: Perform phased migration of devices
6. **Validation**: Verify successful migration and functionality
7. **Decommissioning**: Safely decommission Workspace One environment

### Migration Methods

- **In-place Migration**: Direct transfer of device management from Workspace One to Azure Intune
- **Side-by-side Migration**: Gradual transition with devices temporarily managed by both platforms
- **Fresh Enrollment**: Complete un-enrollment from Workspace One and new enrollment to Azure Intune

## Technical Architecture

### Current Environment

- Workspace One UEM for device management
- PowerShell scripts for automation and validation
- Custom enrollment processes and tools

### Target Environment

- Microsoft Intune for device management
- Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager (when applicable)
- Azure Active Directory for identity management
- Microsoft Defender for Endpoint for security

## Migration Strategy

1. **Phased Approach**:
   - Start with non-critical devices or test groups
   - Gradually expand to critical systems
   - Address complex scenarios last

2. **Policy Mapping**:
   - Document all existing Workspace One policies
   - Identify equivalent Azure/Intune policies
   - Create migration mapping documentation

3. **Application Strategy**:
   - Recreate application packages in Intune
   - Validate application functionality post-migration
   - Address Win32 application conversion challenges

4. **Configuration Management**:
   - Transition configuration profiles to Intune
   - Implement settings using modern methods (CSPs)
   - Validate configurations post-migration

## Tooling and Resources

- **PowerShell Modules**: Custom modules for migration tasks
- **Testing Framework**: Validation scripts to ensure quality
- **Documentation**: Detailed guides for each migration phase
- **Dashboards**: Migration progress visualization tools

## Timeline and Milestones

1. **Project Initiation**: Complete project planning and team formation
2. **Environment Assessment**: Inventory and document current state
3. **Pilot Migration**: Successfully migrate test group
4. **Department Migrations**: Sequential migration of departments
5. **Validation and Cleanup**: Final checks and Workspace One decommissioning

## Success Criteria

1. All devices successfully migrated to Azure Intune
2. All applications and policies correctly functioning in Azure
3. No security vulnerabilities introduced during migration
4. Helpdesk prepared to support the new environment
5. Users able to access all required resources post-migration
6. Complete decommissioning of Workspace One environment

## Challenges and Mitigation

1. **Challenge**: Complex device configurations
   **Mitigation**: Detailed inventory and testing of all configurations

2. **Challenge**: User disruption during migration
   **Mitigation**: Communication plan and off-hours migration when possible

3. **Challenge**: Application compatibility issues
   **Mitigation**: Pre-migration testing of all applications in Azure environment

4. **Challenge**: Security control gaps during transition
   **Mitigation**: Side-by-side management until feature parity confirmed

## Next Steps

1. Complete inventory of all Workspace One managed devices
2. Document all policies and configurations in current environment
3. Develop detailed migration runbooks for each device type
4. Establish Azure/Intune environment according to best practices
5. Begin pilot migration with non-critical devices
