# Project Status Tracking

This document describes how to track, monitor, and update the status of the Workspace ONE to Azure/Intune Migration Toolkit project.

## Overview

The project uses a comprehensive status tracking system to monitor progress of individual modules, scripts, and documentation. The system consists of:

1. A central `index.json` file that stores structured data about all components
2. Dashboard scripts for visualizing progress
3. PowerShell wrappers for easy access to status information

## Current Status

As of the latest update, the project is in the MVP (Minimum Viable Product) development phase with:

- **73% completion of core components**
- 7 fully implemented modules
- 5 partially implemented modules 
- 1 planned module
- 13 total components in the MVP scope

## Viewing Project Status

### Command Line

To view the project status from the command line:

```powershell
# From project root directory
.\Show-Progress.ps1

# For extended view including non-MVP components
.\Show-Progress.ps1 -ShowExtended

# To generate an HTML report
.\Show-Progress.ps1 -Format HTML -SaveReport

# To generate a JSON report to a specific path
.\Show-Progress.ps1 -Format JSON -SaveReport -ReportPath "C:\Reports\"
```

### Dashboard

You can also run the dashboard script directly:

```powershell
# From the dashboard directory
cd dashboard
.\Show-ProjectStatus.ps1

# With specific parameters
.\Show-ProjectStatus.ps1 -ShowExtendedComponents -OutputFormat HTML -OutputPath "project-status.html"
```

## Project Structure in `index.json`

The `index.json` file in the `config` directory contains detailed information about all project components:

- **Project metadata**: name, version, description, status
- **Module information**: implementation status, features, dependencies
- **Script information**: purpose, status, dependencies
- **Documentation status**: which docs are complete vs. in progress
- **Progress metrics**: percentage complete for MVP and extended scope

Example module entry:

```json
"LoggingModule": {
  "path": "src/modules/LoggingModule.psm1",
  "status": "Implemented",
  "inMVP": true,
  "description": "Centralized logging functionality for the entire toolkit",
  "features": [
    {"name": "File Logging", "status": "Implemented"},
    {"name": "Console Logging", "status": "Implemented"},
    {"name": "Event Log Integration", "status": "Implemented"},
    {"name": "Log Rotation", "status": "Implemented"},
    {"name": "Verbosity Levels", "status": "Implemented"}
  ],
  "dependencies": []
}
```

## Updating Project Status

To update the status of a component:

1. Edit the `config/index.json` file directly
2. Update the component's `status` field to one of:
   - `"Implemented"` - Fully implemented and tested
   - `"Partial"` - Partially implemented
   - `"Planned"` - Not yet implemented
3. Update individual feature statuses if needed
4. Update the percentage calculations in the `mvpProgress` or `extendedProgress` sections

Example of updating a module status:

```powershell
# Backup the current index
Copy-Item -Path "config/index.json" -Destination "config/index.json.bak"

# Open the file for editing
notepad "config/index.json"

# After editing, verify the file is valid JSON
$json = Get-Content -Path "config/index.json" -Raw
try {
    $null = $json | ConvertFrom-Json
    Write-Host "JSON is valid" -ForegroundColor Green
} catch {
    Write-Host "JSON has errors: $_" -ForegroundColor Red
}
```

## Calculating Progress Percentage

Progress percentages are calculated based on implementation status:

- Fully implemented components count as 100%
- Partially implemented components count as 50%
- Planned components count as 0%

The overall percentage is the weighted average of all components' status.

The formula is:
```
(# of Implemented * 1.0 + # of Partial * 0.5 + # of Planned * 0.0) / Total Components * 100
```

## Integration with MCP

The project status information is also integrated with the MCP (Mission Control Panel) knowledge graph, with entries for:

- Overall project entity
- Key module entities
- Status tracking entity
- Relationships between components

This provides a comprehensive view of the project structure and dependencies.
