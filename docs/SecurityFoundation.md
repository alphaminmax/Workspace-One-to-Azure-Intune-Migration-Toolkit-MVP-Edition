   - Timeout management
   - Secure header handling

## Integration with High-Priority Components

The Security Foundation module integrates with other high-priority components:

### RollbackMechanism
- Secures backup data with encryption
- Ensures administrative operations are properly elevated
- Audits all rollback operations

### MigrationVerification
- Secures verification data and reports
- Provides secure API access for Azure/Intune validation
- Audits verification results for compliance

### UserCommunicationFramework
- Ensures secure transmission of user notifications
- Protects user feedback data
- Authenticates communication channels

## Key Functions

### Credential Management

#### `Set-SecureCredential`
Stores credentials securely using Windows Credential Manager or encrypted files.

```powershell
$credential = Get-Credential
Set-SecureCredential -Credential $credential -CredentialName "AzureAPI"
```

#### `Get-SecureCredential`
Retrieves previously stored credentials.

```powershell
$apiCred = Get-SecureCredential -CredentialName "AzureAPI"
```

### Data Protection

#### `Protect-SensitiveData`
Encrypts sensitive data using a certificate and stores it securely.

```powershell
# String data
Protect-SensitiveData -Data "api_key_12345" -KeyName "ApiKey"

# Secure string
$securePassword = ConvertTo-SecureString "P@ssw0rd" -AsPlainText -Force
Protect-SensitiveData -Data $securePassword -KeyName "AdminPassword" -AsSecureString
```

#### `Unprotect-SensitiveData`
Retrieves and decrypts protected sensitive data.

```powershell
# Get as plaintext (use carefully)
$apiKey = Unprotect-SensitiveData -KeyName "ApiKey" -AsPlainText

# Get as secure string (preferred)
$securePassword = Unprotect-SensitiveData -KeyName "AdminPassword"
```

### Privilege Management

#### `Invoke-ElevatedOperation`
Executes a script block with elevated privileges if required.

```powershell
Invoke-ElevatedOperation -ScriptBlock {
    # Administrative operation here
    Restart-Service -Name "SomeService"
} -RequireAdmin
```

### Secure Communications

#### `Invoke-SecureWebRequest`
Performs a web request with security best practices for TLS and timeouts.

```powershell
$response = Invoke-SecureWebRequest -Uri "https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/users" -Credential $graphCred -Method Get
```

### Security Configuration

#### `Set-SecurityConfiguration`
Configures security settings for the migration process.

```powershell
Set-SecurityConfiguration -AuditLogPath "C:\Logs\Migration\Security" -RequireAdminForSensitiveOperations $true
```

#### `Test-SecurityRequirements`
Validates that the system meets all security requirements for the migration.

```powershell
if (-not (Test-SecurityRequirements -CheckCertificates -CheckTls)) {
    Write-Warning "System does not meet security requirements"
}
```

#### `Initialize-SecurityFoundation`
Sets up the Security Foundation module and ensures all security requirements are met.

```powershell
Initialize-SecurityFoundation -CreateEncryptionCert
```

### Auditing & Logging

#### `Write-SecurityEvent`
Records security-relevant events in the audit log for compliance and troubleshooting.

```powershell
Write-SecurityEvent -Message "User authentication successful" -Level Information -Component "Authentication"
```

## Security Best Practices

The Security Foundation module implements these security best practices:

1. **Defense in Depth**
   - Multiple layers of security controls
   - Fallback mechanisms when primary security controls are unavailable

2. **Principle of Least Privilege**
   - Operations run with minimal required privileges
   - Temporary elevation only when necessary

3. **Zero Trust Architecture**
   - All credentials verified before use
   - No assumptions about the security of the environment

4. **Secure by Default**
   - Security enabled without user configuration
   - Sensible secure defaults

5. **Audit Everything**
   - Comprehensive logging of security events
   - Immutable audit trail

## Integration Example

The following example shows how to integrate the Security Foundation module into a migration script:

```powershell
# Initialize security
Initialize-SecurityFoundation -CreateEncryptionCert

# Store Azure credentials securely
$credential = Get-Credential -Message "Enter Azure credentials"
Set-SecureCredential -Credential $credential -CredentialName "AzureAPI"

# Use secure credential for Azure operations
$azureCred = Get-SecureCredential -CredentialName "AzureAPI"

# Make secure web request to Azure
Invoke-SecureWebRequest -Uri "https://management.azure.com/subscriptions?api-version=2020-01-01" -Credential $azureCred

# Perform administrative operation with proper elevation
Invoke-ElevatedOperation -ScriptBlock {
    # Administrative tasks here
} -RequireAdmin

# Audit important security events
Write-SecurityEvent -Message "Migration completed successfully" -Level Information
```

## Requirements

- PowerShell 5.1 or higher
- .NET Framework 4.7.2 or higher
- Access to certificate store for encryption operations
- Windows 10/11 or Windows Server 2016+ for all features

## Configuration

The Security Foundation module can be configured by modifying these settings:

- **AuditLogPath**: Location of security audit logs
- **EncryptionCertThumbprint**: Certificate used for encryption
- **SecureKeyPath**: Location of secure key storage
- **ApiTimeoutSeconds**: Timeout for secure web requests
- **RequireAdminForSensitiveOperations**: Whether admin privileges are required
- **UseWindowsCredentialManager**: Whether to use Windows Credential Manager

Example:

```powershell
Set-SecurityConfiguration -AuditLogPath "C:\Logs\Migration\Security" -ApiTimeoutSeconds 60
```

## Recommendations for Use

1. **Initialize Early**: Call `Initialize-SecurityFoundation` at the start of any migration script
2. **Store Credentials Once**: Store credentials using `Set-SecureCredential` once, then retrieve as needed
3. **Use Elevated Operations Sparingly**: Only use `Invoke-ElevatedOperation` when absolutely necessary
4. **Audit Important Events**: Log all security-relevant events with `Write-SecurityEvent`
5. **Secure All Sensitive Data**: Use `Protect-SensitiveData` for any sensitive configuration information

## Security Audit Logs

The Security Foundation module creates detailed audit logs that can be used for compliance purposes. These logs contain:

- Timestamp of each security event
- User and computer information
- Operation details
- Success or failure indication
- Additional context information

Logs are stored in JSON format in the configured audit log path.
