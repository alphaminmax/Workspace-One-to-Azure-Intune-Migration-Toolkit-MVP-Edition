# Integration Tests for Migration Components

This document details the integration testing framework for high-priority components of the Workspace ONE to Azure/Intune migration project.

## Purpose

The integration tests provide a robust validation mechanism for ensuring that all critical components of the migration solution work together as expected. These tests:

- Validate interactions between different components
- Ensure end-to-end workflows function correctly
- Identify integration issues that may not appear in individual component tests
- Simulate real-world migration scenarios

## Test Script Overview

The primary test script `Test-AllHighPriorityComponents.ps1` is designed to:

1. Validate individual component functionality
2. Test the interactions between components
3. Simulate complete migration workflows
4. Generate detailed HTML reports of test results

## Key Features

- **Individual Component Testing**: Tests each high-priority component separately
- **Integration Testing**: Validates proper communication and handoffs between components
- **Mock Mode**: Enables testing without making actual system changes
- **Detailed Reporting**: Generates comprehensive HTML reports with test results
- **Flexible Configuration**: Supports various parameters for customizing test execution

## Test Categories

### Component Tests

| Component | Test | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| RollbackMechanism | Create-SystemRestorePoint | Verifies creation of restore points for disaster recovery |
| RollbackMechanism | Backup-RegistryKey | Tests the ability to backup registry settings |
| RollbackMechanism | Backup-WorkspaceOneConfiguration | Validates WS1 configuration backup functionality |
| RollbackMechanism | Migration-Transaction-Support | Tests transaction handling for atomic operations |
| MigrationVerification | Verify-EnrollmentStatus | Checks if enrollment verification works correctly |
| MigrationVerification | Verify-ConfigurationState | Tests configuration compliance checking |
| MigrationVerification | Verify-ApplicationInstallation | Validates application installation verification |
| MigrationVerification | Generate-VerificationReport | Tests report generation capability |
| UserCommunication | Send-UserNotification | Verifies notification capabilities |
| UserCommunication | Log-UserMessage | Tests user message logging |
| UserCommunication | Show-MigrationProgress | Validates progress reporting functionality |
| MigrationAnalytics | Record-MigrationMetrics | Tests metrics recording functionality |
| MigrationAnalytics | Generate-MigrationReport | Validates report generation capabilities |
| MigrationAnalytics | Track-MigrationPerformance | Tests performance tracking functionality |

### Integration Tests

| Test | Components | Description |
|------|------------|-------------|
| Rollback-Verification-Integration | RollbackMechanism, MigrationVerification | Tests if verification can detect rollback operations |
| Verification-Communication-Integration | MigrationVerification, UserCommunication | Validates if verification results can be communicated to users |
| Analytics-Dashboard-Integration | MigrationAnalytics, MigrationDashboard | Tests if analytics data can be incorporated into dashboard |
| Full-Migration-Workflow-Simulation | All Components | Simulates a complete migration workflow from start to finish |

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```powershell
.\Test-AllHighPriorityComponents.ps1
```

This runs all tests on the local computer.

### Mock Mode

```powershell
.\Test-AllHighPriorityComponents.ps1 -Mock
```

Runs tests in mock mode without making actual system changes.

### Testing Multiple Computers

```powershell
.\Test-AllHighPriorityComponents.ps1 -ComputerName "Computer1","Computer2" -Mock
```

Tests components on multiple computers.

### Selective Testing

```powershell
.\Test-AllHighPriorityComponents.ps1 -SkipComponentTests
.\Test-AllHighPriorityComponents.ps1 -SkipIntegrationTests
```

Run only integration tests or only component tests.

### Custom Paths

```powershell
.\Test-AllHighPriorityComponents.ps1 -LogPath "D:\Logs" -ReportPath "D:\Reports"
```

Specify custom locations for logs and reports.

## Test Reports

The script generates an HTML report that includes:

- Overall test summary and pass rate
- Detailed component test results
- Integration test results
- Environment information
- Test duration and timestamps

### Report Structure

- **Summary Section**: Overall statistics and pass rates
- **Component Tests Section**: Results of individual component tests
- **Integration Tests Section**: Results of cross-component tests
- **Environment Information**: Details about the test environment

## Integration with CI/CD

The integration tests are designed to work within CI/CD pipelines. Example Azure DevOps pipeline configuration:

```yaml
steps:
- task: PowerShell@2
  displayName: 'Run Migration Integration Tests'
  inputs:
    filePath: '$(System.DefaultWorkingDirectory)/src/tests/Test-AllHighPriorityComponents.ps1'
    arguments: '-Mock -LogPath "$(Build.ArtifactStagingDirectory)/TestLogs" -ReportPath "$(Build.ArtifactStagingDirectory)/TestReports"'
    errorActionPreference: 'Continue'

- task: PublishTestResults@2
  displayName: 'Publish Test Results'
  inputs:
    testResultsFormat: 'JUnit'
    testResultsFiles: '$(Build.ArtifactStagingDirectory)/TestReports/*.xml'
    mergeTestResults: true
    testRunTitle: 'Migration Integration Tests'
```

## Best Practices

1. **Run tests in mock mode first**: Always validate tests in mock mode before running on production systems
2. **Include in deployment pipeline**: Run these tests as part of any deployment validation
3. **Regular testing**: Schedule periodic tests to verify continued interoperability
4. **Tests in isolated environment**: When possible, use a dedicated test environment
5. **Review test results**: Regularly review test reports to identify trends or issues

## Extending the Test Framework

To add new tests to the framework:

1. Define new test cases in the `$componentTests` or `$integrationTests` arrays
2. Create appropriate mock implementations in the respective mock strings
3. Implement the test logic in the `TestScript` scriptblock
4. Add documentation for the new tests

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Missing modules | Install required modules or run with `-Mock` parameter |
| Access denied errors | Run PowerShell as administrator or use appropriate credentials |
| Tests failing in CI/CD | Check if CI/CD environment has necessary permissions and prerequisites |
| Mock mode failing | Verify mock implementations match expected function signatures |
| HTML report not generated | Check for write permissions to the report destination folder |
