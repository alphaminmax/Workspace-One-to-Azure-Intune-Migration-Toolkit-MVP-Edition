## Overview

Performance optimization is critical for ensuring timely, efficient, and reliable migrations. This guide covers techniques to minimize migration time, reduce system resource utilization, and enhance the overall user experience during migration.

## Key Performance Metrics

| Metric | Description | Target |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| Total Migration Time | End-to-end time from initiation to completion | < 60 minutes per device |
| System Downtime | Time when device is unavailable to user | < 15 minutes |
| CPU Utilization | Average CPU usage during migration | < 70% |
| Memory Usage | Peak RAM consumption | < 2GB |
| Network Bandwidth | Maximum network throughput required | < 100Mbps |
| Disk I/O | Average disk operations per second | < 500 IOPS |
| Success Rate | Percentage of migrations completed successfully | > 99% |

## Hardware Recommendations

For optimal migration performance:

| Component | Minimum | Recommended |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| CPU | 2 cores, 2.0GHz | 4+ cores, 3.0GHz+ |
| RAM | 4GB | 8GB+ |
| Disk | HDD, 20GB free | SSD, 40GB+ free |
| Network | 10Mbps | 100Mbps+ |

## Network Optimization

### Bandwidth Management

```powershell
# Configure bandwidth throttling during business hours
Set-MigrationThrottling -BusinessHours -MaxBandwidth 50MB

# Disable throttling during off-hours
Set-MigrationThrottling -OffHours -MaxBandwidth Unlimited
```

### Caching Strategies

* **Package Caching**: Enable local caching of installation packages
* **Configuration Caching**: Store common configurations locally
* **Peer Caching**: Leverage peer-to-peer distribution for multi-device migrations

```powershell
# Enable local package caching
Set-MigrationOption -EnablePackageCache $true -CacheLocation "C:\MigrationCache"

# Configure peer caching for devices in the same subnet
Set-MigrationOption -EnablePeerCache $true -PeerCacheDiscovery Subnet
```

### Connection Resilience

* Implement automatic retry logic for network operations
* Use exponential backoff for retries
* Cache data locally during network interruptions

## Workload Parallelization

The migration process can parallelize certain operations:

### Parallel Operations

* Profile backup and Intune enrollment
* App inventory collection and policy preparation
* Configuration extraction and package downloads

```powershell
# Set the maximum number of parallel operations
Set-MigrationOption -MaxParallelOperations 4

# Configure specific parallel operation groups
Set-MigrationOption -ParallelizeAppDownloads $true -ParallelizeProfileBackup $true
```

### Throttling Controls

```powershell
# Set CPU throttling to prevent performance impact
Set-MigrationOption -CpuPriority BelowNormal -MaxCpuPercentage 70

# Configure disk I/O limits
Set-MigrationOption -MaxDiskIOPS 400
```

## Resource Usage Optimization

### Memory Management

* Implement efficient data structures
* Release memory for completed operations
* Use memory compression for large datasets

```powershell
# Configure memory management
Set-MigrationOption -MaxMemoryUsage 1500MB -EnableMemoryCompression $true
```

### Storage Optimization

* Use temporary storage for migration artifacts
* Clean up temporary files as soon as possible
* Implement disk space checks before migration

```powershell
# Configure storage optimization
Set-MigrationOption -TempStoragePath "D:\Temp" -CleanupInterval 10
```

## Runtime Optimizations

### Process Priority

```powershell
# Set process priority based on migration phase
Set-MigrationPhaseOption -Phase "DataCollection" -ProcessPriority Normal
Set-MigrationPhaseOption -Phase "EnrollmentAndMigration" -ProcessPriority AboveNormal
```

### Background Services

* Pause non-essential services during migration
* Restore service state after migration completion

```powershell
# Configure services to pause during migration
$servicesToPause = @("Print Spooler", "Windows Search", "Superfetch")
Set-MigrationOption -PauseServicesWhileMigrating $servicesToPause
```

## Silent Mode Performance

When running in silent mode:

* Disable UI rendering to reduce resource usage
* Minimize logging verbosity
* Optimize for headless operation

```powershell
# Configure for maximum silent mode performance
Set-MigrationOption -SilentMode $true -MinimalLogging $true -DisableProgressUI $true
```

## Multi-Device Migration Strategies

When migrating multiple devices simultaneously:

### Resource Distribution

* Implement distribution servers for large deployments
* Use time windows to stagger migrations
* Configure resource quotas per migration

```powershell
# Configure distribution points
Add-MigrationDistributionPoint -ServerName "Server01" -MaxConcurrentMigrations 50

# Set up migration waves
New-MigrationWave -Name "Wave1" -Devices "devices-wave1.txt" -StartTime "2023-06-15T20:00"
New-MigrationWave -Name "Wave2" -Devices "devices-wave2.txt" -StartTime "2023-06-16T20:00"
```

### Load Balancing

* Distribute migrations across multiple servers
* Monitor server load and adjust distribution
* Implement automatic failover

## Pre-Migration Optimization

Activities to perform before migration:

1. **Disk Cleanup**: Remove temporary files and unnecessary data
2. **Defragmentation**: Optimize disk layout (for HDDs)
3. **System Assessment**: Evaluate system for potential bottlenecks
4. **Package Preparation**: Pre-download required packages

```powershell
# Run pre-migration optimization
Invoke-MigrationPreparation -CleanupDisk $true -OptimizeDisk $true -PreDownloadPackages $true
```

## Application Migration Optimization

### App Prioritization

* Migrate critical applications first
* Defer non-essential applications
* Use dependency mapping to optimize installation order

```powershell
# Configure application migration priority
Set-AppMigrationPriority -CriticalApps "critical-apps.json" -DeferredApps "deferred-apps.json"
```

### Installation Optimization

* Use offline installers where possible
* Leverage MSIX app attach for faster deployment
* Implement parallel app installations

## Profile Transfer Optimization

Optimizing user profile transfer:

1. **Selective Migration**: Transfer only necessary profile components
2. **Compression**: Use efficient compression algorithms
3. **Delta Transfer**: Only transfer changed files
4. **Streaming Transfer**: Begin profile usage before transfer completes

```powershell
# Configure optimized profile transfer
Set-ProfileTransferOption -SelectiveTransfer $true -EnableCompression $true -UseDeltaTransfer $true
```

## Configuration Optimization Matrix

The following matrix provides recommended settings for different environments:

| Setting | Small Environment (<100 devices) | Medium Environment (100-1000 devices) | Large Environment (1000+ devices) |
|---------|----------------------------------|--------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Concurrent Migrations | 10 | 25-50 | 100+ (distributed) |
| Bandwidth Allocation | 70% of available | 50% of available | 30% of available |
| Caching Strategy | Local only | Local + Peer | Distribution points |
| Migration Waves | Optional | Recommended | Required |
| Reporting Detail | Full | Moderate | Summary with exceptions |

## Logging and Telemetry Optimization

Optimize logging for performance:

* Use asynchronous logging
* Implement log buffering
* Adjust logging levels based on migration phase

```powershell
# Configure logging for performance
Set-MigrationLogging -Asynchronous $true -BufferSize 5MB -DefaultLevel Information
```

## Monitoring Performance

Tools for monitoring migration performance:

```powershell
# Get current migration performance metrics
Get-MigrationPerformance

# Start performance monitoring session
Start-MigrationPerformanceMonitor -OutputPath "C:\PerformanceLogs" -SamplingInterval 15
```

## Troubleshooting Performance Issues

| Symptom | Possible Cause | Resolution |
|---------|----------------|------------|
| High CPU usage | Too many parallel operations | Reduce `MaxParallelOperations` setting |
| Slow network transfers | Network congestion or throttling | Use off-hours migration or increase bandwidth allocation |
| Excessive disk I/O | Large profile transfers | Enable compression and selective migration |
| Memory pressure | Large data processing operations | Increase `MaxMemoryUsage` or reduce parallel operations |
| Slow application installs | Application dependencies | Optimize installation order and pre-cache installers |

## Performance Testing

### Benchmark Tests

Run performance benchmarks to establish baselines:

```powershell
# Run migration benchmark
Invoke-MigrationBenchmark -Scenario FullMigration -OutputPath "C:\Benchmarks"

# Run component-specific benchmark
Invoke-MigrationBenchmark -Scenario ProfileTransfer -DeviceProfile "Standard" -OutputPath "C:\Benchmarks"
```

### Load Testing

For large deployments, conduct load testing:

```powershell
# Simulate 50 concurrent migrations
Start-MigrationLoadTest -ConcurrentMigrations 50 -Duration "01:00:00" -SimulationMode
```

## Best Practices Summary

1. **Plan for bandwidth**: Schedule migrations during off-hours when possible
2. **Optimize storage**: Ensure sufficient disk space and use SSDs where available
3. **Balance parallel operations**: Tune concurrency based on available resources
4. **Pre-stage content**: Download packages and updates before migration
5. **Implement caching**: Use caching for multi-device migrations
6. **Monitor performance**: Track key metrics during migration
7. **Stagger large deployments**: Use migration waves for controlled roll-out
8. **Right-size resources**: Allocate appropriate CPU, memory, and network resources
9. **Clean before migrating**: Remove unnecessary files and optimize disks
10. **Test and benchmark**: Establish performance baselines through testing
