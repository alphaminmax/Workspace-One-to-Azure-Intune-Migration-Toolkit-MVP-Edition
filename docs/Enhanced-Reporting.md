## Report Types

### Executive Reports

Executive reports provide high-level summaries focused on:
- Overall migration progress percentage
- Estimated completion timeline
- Success/failure rates
- Key performance indicators

### Technical Reports

Technical reports include more detailed information:
- Component performance metrics
- Error category breakdown
- Time metrics for migration phases
- System-level statistics

### Detailed Reports

Detailed reports provide comprehensive information:
- Device-level migration status
- Complete error logs
- Detailed time breakdowns
- Component-specific metrics

## Dashboard Features

The migration dashboard provides:

1. **Progress Visualization**
   - Gauge charts showing overall completion percentage
   - Timeline projections for completion

2. **Status Breakdown**
   - Pie charts of success/failure distribution
   - Department-specific progress bars

3. **Error Analysis**
   - Top error categories by frequency
   - Trend analysis of errors over time

4. **Performance Metrics**
   - Component performance charts
   - Time distribution by migration phase

## Integration with Other Modules

The EnhancedReporting module integrates with:

- [MigrationAnalytics](./Migration-Analytics.md): For raw metrics collection and processing
- [LoggingModule](./LoggingModule.md): For comprehensive logging
- [SecurityFoundation](./SecurityFoundation.md): For secure credential handling with email authentication
- [UserCommunicationFramework](./UserCommunicationFramework.md): For user notifications about migration progress

## Advanced Features

### Geographical Tracking

For organizations with multiple locations, the reporting system supports geographical distribution visualization:

```powershell
# Register a migration event with location data
Register-MigrationEvent -DeviceName "LAPTOP123" -Status "Completed" -Location "New York Office"

# Generate a location-based report
Send-MigrationReport -Format "HTML" -IncludeLocationData
```

### Department-Based Tracking

Filter and analyze migration progress by organizational units:

```powershell
# Get department-specific statistics
$financeMigration = Get-DepartmentSummaryStats -Department "Finance"
$hrMigration = Get-DepartmentSummaryStats -Department "HR"

# Compare department progress
$deptComparison = Get-DepartmentSummaryStats
```

### Batch Migration Tracking

For phased migrations, track progress by batch:

```powershell
# Register a migration event with batch information
Register-MigrationEvent -DeviceName "LAPTOP123" -Status "Started" -BatchName "Phase1-May2023"

# Get batch-specific statistics
$phase1Progress = Get-BatchSummaryStats -BatchName "Phase1-May2023"
```
