## Key Workflows

### 1. Enrollment Process

1. User launches the enrollment wizard
2. System checks prerequisites and connectivity
3. User authenticates with credentials
4. Device communicates with enrollment server
5. Enrollment is completed and verified
6. Results are logged for tracking

### 2. Script Validation

1. Admin runs TestScripts.ps1
2. Script locates PowerShell scripts to validate
3. Each script is checked for syntax errors
4. Scripts are tested for initialization issues
5. Results are compiled into HTML report
6. Recommendations are provided for any issues

### 3. Deployment Preparation

1. Admin runs Deploy-WS1EnrollmentTools.ps1
2. Admin selects deployment method (Intune, SCCM, GPO)
3. Admin configures custom settings
4. Tool generates deployment-specific files
5. Tool creates instructions for the selected method
6. Deployment package is ready for distribution

### 4. Enrollment Monitoring

1. Admin opens WS1EnrollmentDashboard.html
2. Dashboard loads enrollment data
3. Admin views overall enrollment progress
4. Admin identifies issues by department or device type
5. Admin can drill down into specific problems
6. Dashboard helps track enrollment campaign success
