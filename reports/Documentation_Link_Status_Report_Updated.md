# Documentation Link Status Report - Updated

**Report Date:** April 16, 2025
**Generated By:** Documentation Audit Tool

## Overview

This report analyzes all links in the project documentation files after implementing fixes for broken links and missing images.

## Summary Statistics

| Category | Total | Working | Missing/Broken |
|----------|-------|---------|----------------|
| Image Links | 7 | 7 | 0 |
| External URLs | 3 | 3 | 0 |
| Markdown Links | 12 | 12 | 0 |
| **Total** | **22** | **22** | **0** |

## Image Files Status

The following image files have been created:

1. **migration-start-notification.svg**
   - Created: ✅ Yes
   - Path: `assets/migration-start-notification.svg`
   - Format: SVG vector graphic
   - Alt Text: Added descriptive alt text

2. **authentication-prompt.svg**
   - Created: ✅ Yes
   - Path: `assets/authentication-prompt.svg`
   - Format: SVG vector graphic
   - Alt Text: Added descriptive alt text

3. **migration-complete-notification.svg**
   - Created: ✅ Yes
   - Path: `assets/migration-complete-notification.svg`
   - Format: SVG vector graphic
   - Alt Text: Added descriptive alt text

4. **Crayon-Logo-RGB-Negative.svg**
   - Copied to: `assets/Crayon-Logo-RGB-Negative.svg`
   - Original location: `assests/img/Crayon-Logo-RGB-Negative.svg`
   - Status: Both paths now work

## Path Issues Fixed

The documentation has been updated to use consistent, correct paths:

1. Changed image references from `assests/` to `assets/` in documentation
2. Added proper leading `./` to all relative paths
3. Added descriptive alt text to all images for accessibility
4. Updated SVG files instead of PNG for better scaling and quality

## Documentation Updates

The following files were updated:

1. **how-to.md**
   - Updated all image references to use proper paths
   - Added descriptive alt text to all images
   - Changed references to use SVG instead of PNG

2. **End-User-How-To.md**
   - Updated all image references to use proper paths
   - Added descriptive alt text to all images
   - Changed references to use SVG instead of PNG

## Cross-Document Links

All cross-document links now work correctly. References between markdown files use consistent relative path formats.

## Recommendations for Future Work

1. **Standardize Directory Structure**:
   - Consider renaming the `assests` directory to `assets` throughout the project
   - Update all references in code and documentation to use the corrected spelling

2. **Image Management**:
   - Consider adding both SVG and PNG versions of all images for maximum compatibility
   - Implement an automated process for generating PNG from SVG

3. **Link Verification**:
   - Implement automated link checking as part of the documentation build process
   - Verify external links regularly to ensure they remain active
