   - Status: Missing
   - Recommendation: Create PNG showing a Windows notification about migration start

2. **authentication-prompt.png**
   - Referenced in: `how-to.md` and `End-User-How-To.md`
   - Expected path: `assets/authentication-prompt.png`

## Path Issues

There is a path inconsistency with the Crayon logo reference:

   - Current path: `./assests/img/Crayon-Logo-RGB-Negative.svg` (note the typo in "assests")

## Recommendations

1. **Create Missing Images**:
   - Create the three missing PNG files for notifications and prompts
   - Consider creating SVG versions for better scaling

2. **Fix Path Inconsistencies**:
   - Either correct the directory name from "assests" to "assets"
   - Or update all documentation references to use the current spelling consistently

3. **Standardize Links**:
   - Use relative links consistently for cross-document references
   - Ensure all documentation follows the same linking style

4. **Add Alt Text**:
   - Add descriptive alt text to all image references for accessibility
